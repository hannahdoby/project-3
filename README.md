# **Project 3** -- Yelp API
## Easy to use Travel Guide
When planning your next trip, it's easy to know where you want to go next. The hardest part is knowing that all your necessities are covered when you get there. We made a travel guide with data from Yelp to assist in your decisions on your hotels and restaurants. The map and graph visualizations are customizable and easy for users of any skill level to use.
- The maps and graphs show the top rated hotels and restaurants for the areas you plan to visit
- You can easily filter down to the category and city you're looking for
- See the locations of each marker on the maps so you know exactly where you'll be!
